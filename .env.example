# Your SoundCloud Client ID
REACT_APP_SOUNDCLOUD_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id_here

# ==============================================
# AVAILABLE GENRES
# ==============================================

# The music player supports 6 study/work music genres:
# - Lo-Fi Hip Hop: Chill beats for studying and focus
# - Classical/Piano: Peaceful piano and classical music
# - Ambient/Electronic: Atmospheric sounds for concentration
# - Jazz/Smooth Jazz: Smooth jazz instrumentals
# - Bass Boosted: Deep bass for productivity
# - Chill Trap: Melodic trap beats

# Each genre uses multiple search queries to find high-quality tracks
# All playlists are fetched dynamically from SoundCloud

# ==============================================
# FALLBACK BEHAVIOR
# ==============================================

# If no SoundCloud Client ID is configured:
# - The app will automatically use mock data (3 sample tracks per genre)
# - Mock data is located in src/data/mockPlaylists.js
# - You'll see a console warning: "📀 Using mock data for genre: [genre]"
# - Mock data is intended for development/testing only

# ==============================================
# TROUBLESHOOTING
# ==============================================

# If SoundCloud API is not working:
# 1. Verify your Client ID is correct (no extra spaces or quotes)
# 2. Check browser console for error messages
# 3. Ensure SoundCloud API Terms are accepted in your app settings
# 4. Try the fallback client ID extraction method (automatic)
# 5. If all else fails, the app will use mock data automatically

# Common issues:
# - "401 Unauthorized": Client ID is invalid or expired
# - "429 Too Many Requests": API rate limit reached (wait a few minutes)
# - "403 Forbidden": Track is not available for streaming
# - No errors but no tracks: Check if genre queries need updating

# ==============================================
# NOTES
# ==============================================

# - The app uses React Query for caching (10min stale, 30min cache)
# - Genre switching is instant on cache hits
# - Playlists automatically refetch on window focus
# - Invalid tracks (no stream_url) are filtered automatically
# - All API calls include automatic retry logic (2 attempts)
